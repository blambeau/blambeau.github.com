<p>Welcome to revision-zero.org ! You are reading the really first revision of this web site. If you read this page you are probably asking yourself what this site is about ? It is about computer science, and only about that. So if you&#8217;re not a computer scientist or somewhat interrested by computers, you probably won&#8217;t find any useful information here. Otherwise, read on!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created this web site to share ideas. I&#8217;m a computer scientist, currently attached (as researcher) to the computing science department of the University of Louvain (Universit√© catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium). As a researcher, my job is to have ideas (nice job isn&#8217;t it?) &#8230; sometimes good ones, sometimes not. I&#8217;ve not enough time to implement everything so I&#8217;ve decided to share it ! However, unless you&#8217;re reading this page in the future, you&#8217;ll have to wait for subsequent revisions &#8230; But I can already precise the topic somewhat: this web site will most certainly provide code tricks in Ruby and Java, will certainly talk about databases, requirements engineering and goal modeling in particular, automata, regular languages and induction, I&#8217;m sure web frameworks will have a place, &#8230; But before that, let&#8217;s talk a bit about the web site itself.</p>
<h3>Revision-Zero&#8217;s revisions</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re currently reading revision 0 of this web site. Each time a new article is posted, the revision number is increased. The web site itself will be under constant development. It&#8217;s a choice: I didn&#8217;t wanted to select and learn an &#8216;all-in-the-box&#8217; blog implem or something like that. So I will create it myself, pragmatically, implementing features when need arrive &#8230; Some posts here will certainly talk about  that development. Revision number 0 is an hand-written simple html page. You can read future revisions of this one with a simple <span class="caps">URL</span> pattern:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.revision-zero.org/32">http://www.revision-zero.org/32</a></p>
<p>for example, will bring you to the revision numbered 32, which (if already available) is about some computer science topic, maybe about this site development, maybe not.</p>
<h3>Revision 0&#8217;s implementation</h3>
<p>This first revision of the web site is pragmatic and simple: it&#8217;s a simple <span class="caps">HTML</span>/<span class="caps">CSS</span> file, and something like the following lines in the .htaccess file, providing the first navigation mechanism:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>RewriteRule ^$                   0                   # leads to last revision 
RewriteRule ^(\d+)$              pages/$1.html       # leads to an exact revision

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}  !-f                 # leads to future (no such file)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$               pages/404.html [L]
</pre></div>
<p>Simple isn&#8217;t it?? Everything will certainly change in the implementation in a really short-term future but it makes the job for now and has been implemented in a couple of minutes (I&#8217;m lying: I don&#8217;t masterize mod_rewrite at all and it took a lot of time to me to write these simple four lines. It should be read as: <em>[&#8230;] it makes the job for now and <b>can</b> be implemented in a couple of minutes</em>).</p>

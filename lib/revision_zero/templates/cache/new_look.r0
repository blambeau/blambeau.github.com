<p>Revision-Zero.org has <a href="new_look#look">a new look</a>, <a href="new_look#implem">a new implementation</a> (no that much actually), <a href="new_look#libraries">new libraries</a> and &#8230; <a href="new_look#visitors">new visitors</a>! Let briefly discuss these news in turn.</p>
<h3 id="visitors">Thank you visitors</h3>
<p>According to google analytics, the <a href="logical_data_independence">first paper on Logical Data Independence</a> has been read by a lot of people (I&#8217;m really impressed I admit). That&#8217;s a great idea visitors, the <a href="logical_data_independence2">next paper about this topic</a> will then be made available quickly! My blog does not allow posting comments for now, but don&#8217;t hesitate to send me an email (blambeau at gmail) if one topic really matters for you!</p>
<h3 id="libraries">Thank you <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a></h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve moved a lot of my open-source developments on <a href="http://github.com/blambeau">github</a> recently. There&#8217;s new libraires there:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/blambeau/wlang">WLang</a> is now considered stable (version 0.9.1). For recall, WLang is a code generator and templatin engine. This blog, for example is entirely generated with WLang (see <a href="new_look#implem">below</a>)</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/blambeau/waw">Waw</a> is a web framework, an alternative to Rails! More information about it in a few weeks. Waw is currently in very active development, but has its first adopters: have a look at the website of <a href="http://www.hit-radio.be">Hit-Radio</a>, a new belgian radio and the <a href="http://uclouvain.acm-sc.be">UCLouvain <span class="caps">ACM</span> Student Chapter</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/blambeau/dbagile">DbAgile</a> is the library I will use to celebrate the 40th birthday of the relational model. It&#8217;s time to have tools for managing our databases&#8230; and it&#8217;s time to provide alternatives to ORMs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implem">Thank you <a href="http://coderay.rubychan.de/">CodeRay</a>, <a href="http://redcloth.org/">RedCloth</a>, <a href="http://github.com/blambeau/wlang">WLang</a></h3>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said previously, this blog has a new implementation. The principle (explained in <a href="web_duck_typing">first posts</a>) is unchanged, but WLang is now used to <a href="book">generate the website in different versions</a>. The migration from dedicated code to WLang opens a lot of possibilities: inline code is pretty-printed thanks to <a href="http://coderay.rubychan.de/">coderay</a>, sources of the articles are now written in <a href="http://redcloth.org/">redcloth</a>, and so on. The source code is really simple, and distributed for free on my <a href="http://github.com/blambeau/blambeau.github.com/tree/revision-zero">github pages repository</a>. Have a look at the revision-zero branch and on the <a href="book">book post</a>, it&#8217;s so simple ;-)</p>

<p>Once again&#8230; because designing websites is not an art I master. I&#8217;m currently looking for logos, images, web designs for my different open-sources projects (and for Revision-Zero.org as well)&#8230; notice to fans ;-)</p>

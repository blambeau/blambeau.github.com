            <h2>Revision-Zero is born!</h2>
            
            <p>Welcome to revision-zero.org ! You are reading the really first revision of this web site.
            If you read this page you are probably asking yourself what this site is about ? It is 
            about computer science, and only about that. So if you're not a computer scientist or 
            somewhat interrested by computers, you probably won't find any useful information here. 
            Otherwise, read on!</p>
            
            <p>I've created this web site to share ideas. I'm a computer scientist, currently attached 
            (as researcher) to the computing science department of the University of Louvain (Universit√© 
            catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium). As a researcher, my job is to have ideas (nice job 
            isn't it?) ... sometimes good ones, sometimes not. I've not enough time to implement everything 
            so I've decided to share it ! However, unless you're reading this page in the future, you'll have 
            to wait for subsequent revisions ... But I can already precise the topic somewhat: this web site will
            most certainly provide code tricks in Ruby and Java, will certainly talk about databases, requirements
            engineering and goal modeling in particular, automata, regular languages and induction, I'm sure web
            frameworks will have a place, ... But before that, let's talk a bit about the web site itself.</p>
            
            <h3>Revision-Zero's revisions</h3>
            <p>You're currently reading revision 0 of this web site. Each time a new article is posted, the
            revision number is increased. The web site itself will be under constant development. It's a choice: 
            I didn't wanted to select and learn an 'all-in-the-box' blog implem or something like that. So I will create it myself,
            pragmatically, implementing features when need arrive ... Some posts here will certainly talk about  
            that development. Revision number 0 is an hand-written simple html page. You can read future
            revisions of this one with a simple URL pattern:</p> 
            
            <p style="text-align: center"><a href="32">http://www.revision-zero.org/32</a></p> 
            <p>for example, will bring you to the revision numbered 32, which (if already available) is about some 
            computer science topic, maybe about this site development, maybe not.</p>
            
            <h3>Revision 0's implementation</h3>
            
            <p>This first revision of the web site is pragmatic and simple: it's a simple HTML/CSS file, and
            something like the following lines in the .htaccess file, providing the first navigation mechanism:</p>
            
            <div class="sourcecode"><pre>
RewriteRule ^$                    0                       # leads to last revision 
RewriteRule ^(\d+)$               pages/$1.html           # leads to exact one

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}   !-f                     # leads to future (no such file)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$                pages/future.html [L]</pre></div>

            <p>Simple isn't it?? Everything will certainly change in the implementation in a really short-term future
            but it makes the job for now and has been implemented in a couple of minutes (I'm lying: I don't masterize 
            mod_rewrite at all and it took a lot of time to me to write these simple four lines. It should
            be read as: <em>[...] it makes the job for now and <b>can</b> be implemented in a couple of minutes</em>).</p>
            
            <h3>Revision-Zero's material</h3>
            
            <p>And now, for something really important. Unless stated explicitely, all ideas written here are the intellectual

            also deserve special thanks for his help and support!</p>
            
            <p>See you at revision 1, enjoy Revision-Zero!</p>

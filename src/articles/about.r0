h3. Using it

- sequentially := Really first post of this blog is at @{0}{http://www.revision-zero.org/0}. The next one is at @{1}{http://www.revision-zero.org/1}, and so on. If you want to read all posts sequentially, that's a way to do it (you can also use the _previous_ and _next_ buttons to achieve the same goal).

- by topic := You can access a given topic by its name (if you know it) with an url like this: @{about}{http://www.revision-zero.org/about}. Short topic names always match the <code>[a-zA-Z-0-9_]+</code> regular expression. Moreover, you'll find (not so special) posts where I maintain a TODO list of the topics I would like to write about. The first
topic post is at @{topics0}{http://www.revision-zero.org/topics0}, the next one will be at @{topics1}{http://www.revision-zero.org/topics1} and so on. For your ease, those topic pages are linked together: previous and next links <b>at bottom</b> of the topic pages implement a linked list of topic posts. 

- rss := Probably the easiest way to stay in touch: http://www.revision-zero.org/rss. You can add this rss flux to your "iGoogle":http://www.google.com/ig home page, or read it with "Google Reader":http://www.google.com/reader/view.

- by proposals := You would like a topic to be addressed ? If it already exists in the topic pages but is not written yet, simply click on the topic name and I'll be informed of your interest. Otherwise, send me an email with your proposal and I'll see if I can do something! 

h3. The author

This blog is written by Bernard Lambeau, an active researcher of the "computer science departement":http://www.uclouvain.be/ingi.html of the "University of Louvain":http://www.uclouvain.be (Universite catholique de Louvain, Belgium). You can join me about this blog by email: blambeau at 'the well-known google messaging service'. 

h3. The objectives

I'm a researcher in computer science so this blog talks about computer science. My primary aim is to share ideas. I'm not sure all are good ideas, but I'm pretty convinced that at least one or two are not so bad. My second objective is also to provided open-source code implementing these ideas. I will not give implementations for all of them, for two reasons: firstly, some ideas are not implemented at all; others are sometimes 'proof-of-concepts' projects and the source code can be ugly, not sufficiently tested or not well documented. However, I'll often give short code excerpts for simple things, and give pointers to stable, tested and documented projects when they are.

As will quickly appear, I'm a "never happy" guy and have the easy criticism. The <em>without offense guys</em> rule always applies here: it's because things exist but are sometimes imperfect that we can make it better! All criticized ideas, projects and implementations are an inspiration source for me; I'm really grateful to their authors for providing them !

h3. Credits

I'm really grateful to the University of Louvain (for providing me such a nice job), and colleagues (for fruitful discussions about computer science in general and some of the ideas presented here in particular). I also would like to thank David Herreman  (the one I don't know) for the CSS template that I've downloaded for free from "free-css-templates.com":http://www.free-css-templates.com.

<em>Redde Caesari quae sunt Caesaris</em>: ideas here are naturally inspired from the work of other computer scientists. I always try to provide references in my writings (don't hesitate to send me an email if you think that a reference is clearly missing in a given article). I would like to mention two authors in particular, C.J. Date and Hugh Darwen, and their "third-manifesto":http://www.thethirdmanifesto.com which is one of my biggest inspiration sources.

Special thanks go to my brother Louis for being so interested by my ideas, for his help in trying to implement them, for his administration of the hosting server of this blog and for maintaining "chefbe.net":http://www.chefbe.net development 
tools.

Today's writing is really short and is a poll. So please use the comment feature to answer it. Let consider the tables below for a relational schema about people owning pictures (I suppose that a BLOB column could hold the picture, but this is not important here):

p=. !@{images/sql-poll/model.gif}!

Now, consider the following SQL query that returns all columns of the <code>people</code> table as well as the number of <code>pictures</code> each people has in the database:

#<{sql}{
SELECT id, 
       email,
       name,
       (SELECT count(*) 
          FROM pictures
          WHERE pictures.owner = people.id) as nb_picts
  FROM people
}

Here is the poll. What do you think about this query?

# Exactly what you'd have written
# You prefer to use a GROUP BY
# It's probably correct, but you're not sure 
# You would never write such a query, it is certainly inefficient
# The query is incorrect, we can't write this in SQL
# Other (please explain)

Post your response as a 1-6 number using the comment feature below (there is no particular trap). 

Thanks!
